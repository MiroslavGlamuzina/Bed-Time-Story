# Bed-Time-Story
<p>
Bed Time Story is Google Cardboard survival based game developed by me overnight as part of a Google Cardboard virtual reality competition hosted by Archiact Interactive (Creators of Lamper VR).</p>
<p> <em> This was my first encounter/day with either Google Cardboard or Unity. I am fully aware that this could've been written much better.</em></p>

<p>
Graphics and gameplay based off of the Unity tutorials.
Modified for virtual reality experience using the Google Cardboard.</p>
