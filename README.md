# Bed Time Story
<p>
Bed Time Story is Google Cardboard survival based game developed by me overnight as part of a Google Cardboard virtual reality competition hosted by Archiact Interactive (Creators of Lamper VR).</p>
<p> <em> This was my first encounter/day with either Google Cardboard or Unity. I am fully aware that this could've been written much better.</em></p>

<h5>Note:</h5> 
<em>All modified source is inside of the folder named <strong>_CompletedAssets</strong></em>. <br/>
<strong>I do not own the assets. </strong>

<p>
Graphics and gameplay based off of the Unity tutorials.
Modified for virtual reality experience using the Google Cardboard.</p>
